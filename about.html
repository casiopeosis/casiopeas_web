                Despite always being of a history and languages freak, all my life I had a great interest for mathematics and reason, that's why<br>
                I’ve been involved in competitive mathematics since middle school, including participating in the 2018 and 2019 Mexican Math Olympiads, 
                <br>which helped strengthen the way I approach problems. I love being methodical and using my creativity
                <br> and enjoy coming up with elegant solutions to any type of problem.<br><br>
                My technical background includes experience with R, SQL, C, C++, Java, and more recently Python, which I’m have been recently using to learn data analysis and statistical modeling. 
                <br>I’m especially interested in statistics, probability, and quantitative finance, and I enjoy projects that sit at the intersection of theory and application.

            <p>
                I like playing the piano, chess and souls-like games and Counter-Strike, as well as
                reading nonfiction and <br> historical books by authors like Yukio Mishima, Fyodor Dostoevsky and Julius Evola.
                <br> My favorite artists include Kanye West, Ichiko Aoba and Massive Attack.
                <br> I am always open to learning new things, languages and meeting new people.
